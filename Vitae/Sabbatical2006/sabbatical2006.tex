\section*{Eligibility}

   1.  Leaves of absence shall be extended only to those in teaching positions at the rank of Assistant Professor and above, to full-time administrators, and to professional librarians of equivalent professorial rank. Faculty members with reduced-load appointments are eligible for sabbaticals with pro-rated salary.
   2. A person will be eligible after completing six (6) years of service in a professorial rank or its equivalent at Calvin College. A person who has had a sabbatical is not again eligible until he or she has completed another six (6) years of service at Calvin College. The time spent in any leave of absence is not counted in the six years required for eligibility for a sabbatical.
   3. A sabbatical leave shall be granted primarily on the basis of an evaluation of the worthwhileness of the project to be undertaken. Secondary consideration will be given to the number of years in service without a leave. An applicant, to be eligible for a sabbatical, must give evidence of having done preliminary research or of having engaged in scholarly or professional activity related directly to preparation for the projected leave of absence.
   4. Eligible persons are not entitled to a sabbatical leave; it is granted only after adequate consideration has been given to the application and to the needs and interests of the college. Planning for a sabbatical leave must not be done without first consulting the department chair and the academic dean of the division.
